# A CAL Image Processing Library

This _ImageProcessing_ Orcc project contains low, medium and high
level image processing algorithms in CAL.

A subset of the CAL packages were implemented as part of a Masters
group project at Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: _F21DG 2016-2017:
Design and Code Project, __"Image processing for CAL"___, which was
supported by the EPSRC Rathlin project
([EP/K009931/1](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K009931/1)).

The Masters project report is online:

The other implementations were incoroporated from the existing _RIP_
Orcc project.

- The _low level_ algorithms are pixelwise operations and geometric
  image transforms.

- The _medium level_ algorithms are connected components labelling,
  edge detection and texture analysis.
  
- The _high level_ algorithm is a Histogram of Gradients (HOG)
  implementation, which can be connected to a support vector machine
  (SVM) for object detection as future work.
